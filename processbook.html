            Data Collection & Preparation
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the planning process for the visualization, we envisioned a dataset containing all of the Billboard song charts as far back as they're available, along 
            with the corresponding metadata for every song. This metadata would contain standard information like year, artist, and album, as well as less-accessible 
            information like genre.
        </p>
        <p>
            To weave together this dataset, we combined Billboard archives from the <a href="http://umdmusic.com/">Ultimate Music Database</a> with data from the
            <a href="https://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm API</a>. Last.fm is a website that, among other things, crowdsources genre tags for artists and albums. For 
            each song in our dataset, we included the corresponding genre for the artist. We decided that using the genre for the artist instead of album would 
            provide us with the right balance of genre availability and specificity.
